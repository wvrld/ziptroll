This is hydrogen bomb of all zip bombs.

(300 septillion yottabytes)
it has 34 layers of compression
each layer has 16 zip files
at the very bottom it has a 4gb file

so to calculate the size in gb:
```16^34=8.71122859E40 (an 8 followed by 40 zeros, or 80 duodecillion)
8.71122859E40*4 = 3.48449144E41 (a bit over 300 duodecillion)
3.48449144E41 GB converted to YB (yottabytes) = 3.4845E+26 YB (a 3 followd by 26 zeros is 300 septillion)
```
